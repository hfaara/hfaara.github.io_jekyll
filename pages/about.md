# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
Towards exploring the intersection between code and the life sciences, I’m a molecular biology research assistant with an interest
in building computational models to simulate biological processes. Through my interests, I’ve garnered experience in developing
novel cross-platform native programs and apps for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. I have an advanced command of data structures and algorithms, and I’m an effective team player, problem solver, and collaborator with a proven record of optimizing productivity within the development process.
